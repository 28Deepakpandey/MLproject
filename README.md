## End to End machine Learning  Project


# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict student performance using a variety of features such as parental education, test attendance, and other academic/demographic attributes. It follows an end-to-end pipeline that includes data ingestion, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.
